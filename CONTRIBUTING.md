# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

## How to Contribute
1. Create an issue: If you have found a bug or have a feature request, please create an issue first. This allows the maintainers to discuss the proposed change and ensure that it aligns with the project's goals and direction. Please include as much information as possible, such as steps to reproduce the issue or a detailed description of the new feature.
2. Create a feature branch: Once the issue has been approved, fork the repository and create a new branch based on the latest code in the `main` branch. Name the branch something descriptive, preferably containing the issue number and title, e.g. `3-improving-sse-parsing`. Make your changes in this branch.
3. Make changes and commit: Make your changes in the feature branch and commit them with clear and concise commit messages. Make sure your code follows the project's coding style guidelines.
4. Push your changes: Once you are done making changes, push your changes to your forked repository.
5. Create a pull request: Create a pull request to merge your changes into the `main` branch. Your pull request should include a detailed description of the changes you made, as well as any relevant screenshots or tests. The maintainers will review your pull request and provide feedback.
6. Respond to feedback: The maintainers may provide feedback on your pull request. Please respond to the feedback and make any necessary changes.
7. Merge your changes: Once your changes have been approved, the maintainers will merge your changes into the `main` branch.

## Keep in Mind
* Test your changes thoroughly: Make sure your changes do not introduce any new bugs or regressions. Make sure the existing tests pass after you have made your changes. Introduce new tests to cover the changes you have introduced. 
* Keep your branch up-to-date: If the main branch has changed while you were working on your feature branch, rebase your feature branch on the tip of `main` to avoid conflicts.
* Be respectful: We strive to maintain a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. Please be respectful and professional in your interactions with other contributors and maintainers.
